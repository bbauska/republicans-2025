# Elon Musk &amp; his lies


## Every accusation is a confession with these dumb mother-fuckers.

For my sins, I have occasionally taken my Republican countrymen at their word when they’ve sworn 
up and down that their first and primary principle is fealty to the Constitution of the United 
States. Fool that I was, I expected those folks would be the tiniest bit upset that President 
Donald Trump is flagrantly refusing to comply with a court order, and in so doing is, you know, 
threatening the very rule of law in America.

This isn’t a minor policy dispute, it’s a wrecking ball free from any and all constraints on 
the power of the presidency. Wasn’t Biden supposed to be the dictator? Obama? Where are the 
Republicans shouting about the dangers of tyranny now? It’s almost like they never meant it 
at all.

The June 16 article “Don’t bring a gun to the NC legislature. Here’s what happens when 
someone does” says everything about the hypocrisy of today’s Republican Party. On one 
hand, Republicans support the freedom to carry a gun for nearly every adult citizen 
without a permit. On the other, when their own safety is in jeopardy, they sing a 
different tune. If only they were as concerned about voters as themselves.

<h2>No Kings</h2>
Voices were loud and clear during the No Kings rallies throughout North Carolina and the nation. 
Our citizens clearly communicated to government officials: We the People want democracy. We the 
People want human rights. We the People want to maintain solid relationships with our 
traditional allies. What is happening to our nation is an abomination. It is an insult to 
our Founding Fathers and to the principles upon which the U.S. was founded. Residents of 
NC’s 100 counties are watching the state legislature and Congress members. We demand that 
they start acting on behalf of democracy and stop kissing the ring of autocracy. With all 
due respect to our elected leaders, each of you works for North Carolina’s citizens. We ask 
that you listen to us and respect this country’s 250-year history. Kathy Repass, Cary 

<h2>Veterans</h2> 
I served for more than a decade in the Air Force and flew over 150 combat sorties in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. President Donald Trump tells us that he is an ally to veterans, that he is fighting 
for our well-being. His former chief of staff, retired Marine General and gold star father John 
Kelly, has made it clear how Trump feels about those who sacrifice for the country. 

The President is seeking to cut billions of dollars from veteran service programs. He supported 
DOGE’s mass firing of hardworking veterans from their government jobs. He said nothing when DOGE 
fired veteran crisis hotline staff, which works to stop veteran suicide. The Trump administration 
continues to neglect veterans’ interests. It’s working to pass a budget that would reduce 
Medicaid spending by at least $600 billion. That would rip health care from veterans as well as 
children, seniors and the disabled. To honor service members, Congress must vote no on this 
dangerous budget. Alex Rich, Durham 

<h2>SNAP</h2>
SNAP allows millions of NC children, families, people with disabilities, veterans and seniors 
to better afford groceries, while boosting our economy. This is important because the cost of 
groceries is increasing while families’ wages are flat, if not decreasing. But SNAP is at risk 
of up to $300 billion in cuts due to the Republicans’ “Big Beautiful Bill.” This is more like 
a Big Awful Betrayal for families and for our economy if passed. Our Senate leaders must do 
something to protect the poor and working class in NC.

These cuts will hurt those that need help most and make people’s lives more difficult, especially 
parents. Our families need solutions to rising costs, healthcare and child care. Our Senators must 
reject the House budget and protect our families, NC businesses and economy by strengthening SNAP. 
Nichole Baldridge, Apex 

<h2>Wake schools</h2>
After graduating my youngest child from high school, I had a moment to reflect on 17 years in 
Wake County Public Schools. I am filled with immense gratitude for all the people in our school 
system who have invested in my children. In a time when public education is under attack, I 
wanted to recognize these individuals for their contributions. Although there were times I didn’t 
agree with approach or style, I always knew they had my kids’ best interest at heart. My children 
were safe, well-fed, cared for and educated. From the teachers who work many long days, to the 
bus drivers, administrators, cafeteria and other support staff — I see and appreciate you! Both 
of my kids are continuing their education at public universities. The system isn’t perfect, but 
it works. Public school employees who have devoted their expertise certainly do not do it for 
the pay but instead for their passion for teaching the next generation. Thank you, Wake County 
Public School employees, for all you do. I will be forever grateful.
