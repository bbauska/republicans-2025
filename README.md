# republicans-2025 Trump Derangement Syndrome
Every accusation is a confession with these dumb mother-fuckers.

For my sins, I have occasionally taken my Republican countrymen at their word when they’ve sworn up and down that their first and primary principle is fealty to the Constitution of the United States. Fool that I was, I expected those folks would be the tiniest bit upset that President Donald Trump is flagrantly refusing to comply with a court order, and in so doing is, you know, threatening the very rule of law in America.

This isn’t a minor policy dispute, it’s a wrecking ball free from any and all constraints on the power of the presidency. Wasn’t Biden supposed to be the dictator? Obama? Where are the Republicans shouting about the dangers of tyranny now? It’s almost like they never meant it at all.
